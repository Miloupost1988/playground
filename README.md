Playground repo for small assignments 

1st assignment: 

Set up your terminal and pick your favourite text editor.
I love Atom as a text editor, and in this blogpost they use that also. Feel free to use something else if you prefer. (Sublime text or Visual Code).

Follow the instructions in the link underneath.
